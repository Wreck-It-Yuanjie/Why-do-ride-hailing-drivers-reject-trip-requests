# Effect of trip attributes on ridehailing driver trip request acceptance


## About
Welcome to our ridehailing driver behavior project!

We estimate a generalized additive mixed model to investigate the factors that impact ridehailing driversâ€™ trip request acceptance choices, relying on 200 responses from a stated preference survey in Seattle, US.

If you are interested in ridehailing service research, come and have a look at our project! ðŸ–– ðŸ‘€

## Main takeaways
* Ridehailing drivers are less likely to accept trips with longer pick-up times; the relationship is linear for short trips when the trip is below 45 minutes, while nonlinear otherwise
* Trips over 45 minutes, surge price, and higher passenger ratings increase the probability of trip request acceptance
* Ridehailing drivers are less likely to accept shared trips than solo ones
* the effects of ridehailing driversâ€™ socio-demographics and employment status are statistically non-significant
 
## Future directions
* Future studies might consider including drivers from other channels (e.g., hailing rides) to provide a more representative view of ridehailing drivers.
* Future efforts should identify and consider certain factors to have a better understanding of the relationship between trip features and driversâ€™ behavior. For example, the City of Seattle has a higher pay rate than surrounding cities such as Tacoma and Renton, thus drivers might prefer trips within the city of Seattle. 
* The COVID-19 pandemic might have affected driversâ€™ perceptions on shared rides.
